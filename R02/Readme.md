“Abstract: Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment condition associated with
significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. Unfortunately, waiting
times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and procedures are not cost effective. The economic impact
of autism and the increase in the number of ASD cases across the world reveals an urgent need for
the development of easily implemented and effective screening methods.  

Therefore, a time-efficient and accessible ASD screening is imminent to help health professionals and
inform individuals whether they should pursue formal clinical diagnosis. Hence, we propose a new
dataset related to autism screening of adults that contained features to be utilised for further analysis
especially in determining influential autistic traits and improving the classification of ASD cases. In
this dataset, we record ten behavioural features (Questions) plus other individual characteristics that
have proved to be effective in detecting the ASD cases from controls in behaviour science.”  

The task is to use logistic regression to determine the factors that predict probability of an autism
diagnosis.
