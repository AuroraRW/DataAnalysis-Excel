# Question
The Canadian Federal Election of 2015 was overseen and administered by Elections Canada. There
are 338 electoral districts in Canada, each with several candidates (one for each party and
independents) running to win the right to represent that electoral district.  
Each Electoral district is divided in to a number of polling stations (locations at which voters place
their votes). After the election, each candidate is interested in the poll by poll results to determine
which areas of their district gave them strong support and which gave them weak support. They can
then use this information to help determine advertising expenditures in subsequent elections.  
You have been engaged to assist a specific candidate in a specific electoral district (per the
spreadsheet in the assignment folder) in a post-election analysis of the results.  
Task 1:  
Create a pie chart showing the total votes for the district for all candidates (i.e. it should
demonstrate percentage of the vote each got). Calculate the IQV for the total votes for all
parties. What does this say about how close the election was?
For your candidate, create and correctly label a histogram and a box-and-whisker plot for each
of the features: Percentage of vote, Percentage of voters casting a ballot (i.e. “turn out”), and
Percentage of total electors.  
Task 2:  
Using the 1.5IQR definition we discussed in class, clearly identify the outliers in each
column of data.  
Task 3:
Is there a correlation between voter turn out and your candidate’s electoral
performance in the electoral district?
Is there a correlation between your candidate’s performance and any other variables in this study
file?
Demonstrate this correlation (if any) graphically and numerically. What are some possible
reasons for this?  
Task 4:  
Assuming the patterns for the Election you are studying hold for the next election, at
which five polling stations should each candidate spend their advertising money next Election,
and which five should they not spend any money on? Justify your answer with appropriate
evidence and reasoning.
